# Themes Directory

This is a very project-specific directory and will likely not be needed for smaller apps. However, if you have a large application, it is not too uncommon to have multiple themes (i.e. a Dark theme and/or a Light theme). They could be stored in this directory.

All elements pertaining to the Default theme should go in a _default.scss file.
