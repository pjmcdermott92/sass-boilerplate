# Sass Boilerplate

This is a Sass project boilerplat that follows the [7-1 Architecture](https://pjmcdermott92.medium.com/the-7-1-scss-architecture-430c50b1f35a).

The main.scss File should contain ONLY @import to import all other stylesheets and comments. THis is the main file that will pull in all other modules and compile to a single CSS file in production.
